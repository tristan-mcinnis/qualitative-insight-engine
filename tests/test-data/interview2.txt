Date: 2024-01-16
Participant: User B

Interviewer: How do you currently analyze qualitative data?

User B: I use various tools, but none of them really meet all my needs. I often have to switch between different applications to get the job done.

Interviewer: What would an ideal solution look like?

User B: Something that's fast, intuitive, and provides comprehensive analysis. I need to identify themes quickly, see patterns across multiple interviews, and generate professional reports.

Interviewer: What about collaboration features?

User B: That would be amazing. Being able to share insights with my team and get their input would streamline our research process significantly.
